                           Custom Report with Custom Filter in Salesforce

This is used to apply filter from third party app to fetch data from salesforce (Test from Postman).
First create a new Report in Salesforce.

To filter a report, set filter values in the report metadata and then run the report. The following example retrieves the report metadata, overrides the filter value, create new filters and, runs the report. 
The example:
-Retrieves the report filter object from the metadata by using the ReportMetadata.getReportFilters method.
-Sets the value in the filter to a specific date by using the ReportFilter.setValue method and runs the report.
-Overrides the filter value to a different date and runs the report again.

For the test class:
The Reporting Apex methods don't run in system mode, they run in the context of the current user (also called the context user or the logged-in user). The methods have access to whatever the current user has access to.

In Apex tests, report runs always ignore the SeeAllData annotation, regardless of whether the annotation is set to true or false. This means that report results will include pre-existing data that the test didnâ€™t create. There is no way to disable the SeeAllData annotation for a report execution. To limit results, use a filter on the report.
